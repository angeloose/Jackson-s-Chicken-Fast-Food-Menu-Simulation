# Jackson's-Chicken-Fast-Food-Menu-Simulation

# Project submitted for the AP Computer Science Principles test in 2021

# Purpose is to simulate a fast food menu through a fictional restaurant. It allows the user to browse through a vast menu and keeps track of what items are ordered, and tallies up the final bill which is displayed at the end. Similar to an actual fast food chain, a daily deal is supported in the menu with use of the a cake flavor that changes each time the code is started
